## Pomodoro Application

This project is a Pomodoro Application built using the Hilla framework, which combines Spring Boot on the server
side and React on the client side. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in
the late 1980s. This application helps users to use the Pomodoro Technique by providing a customizable timer to track
work and break intervals.

## About Hilla

Hilla is a full-stack framework that allows developers to build modern web applications using Java on the backend and
React on the frontend. Hilla seamlessly integrates the two technologies, providing a robust environment for rapid
application development with strong type safety and efficient data handling. Hilla also provides UI components that can be utilized
for a more professional application. 

What are the benefits of Hilla?

- Saves development time by simplifying communication between the frontend and Java backend, eliminating the need to create a REST API;

- Enforces end-to-end type-safety, identifying errors during the build process, when they are faster to fix, and ensuring they donâ€™t make it into production;

- Reduces the time to build a UI with more than 45 ready-made components plus a fully-customizable theme, all maintained by Vaadin;

- Simplifies security with endpoints that are secured by default and validation that ensures data integrity across the server and client; and

- Gets you started quickly with a zero-configuration toolchain for building both your frontend and backend.
